Vue Typescript Getter Computed Once Demo
========================================

The `getter` method in a vue component is computed only once.

Display many times:

![demo1.jpg](./images/demo1.jpg)

Only computed once (good!):

![demo2.jpg](./images/demo2.jpg)

Run
---

```
npm install
npm run serve
```

Open browser's developer console, then change the content of the textfield, watch the log in developer console.
