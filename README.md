Vue Typescript Getter Calculated Once Demo
==========================================

The `getter` method in a vue component is calculated only once (that's good).

Display many times:

![demo1.jpg](./images/demo1.jpg)

Only calculated once:

![demo2.jpg](./images/demo2.jpg)

Run
---

```
npm install
npm run serve
```

Open browser's developer console, then change the content of the textfield, watch the log in developer console.
